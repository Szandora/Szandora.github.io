Earlier this week, I started one of the most difficult assignments in the Full Stack Web Development V5 curriculum, the CLI Data Gem Project in Object Oriented Ruby. It's so difficult because you are required to make your own CLI app from scratch with scraping. 

I opened up the assignment, started brainstorming ideas for what app I wanted to create, and then began my writing out my pseudo code for it. Then I decided to start with scraping and that's when I realized I kind of had no idea what I was doing and... I got stuck. I spent 2 days trying to figure out what I should do to write my scraping code. I want to work through this on my own a bit before resorting to asking for help (which is something you can always do here at Flatiron), but I realized I need a break from this project. This is when I realized something important.

It wasn't coding that I needed a break from, just this project. So, I decided I wanted to keep learning and making progress with my coding adventure... and I finally overcame my obsession with needing to complete every lesson in order, and skipped over the rest of OO Ruby to start the next topic and set of lessons in SQL. I just started this morning and all I can say is, wow, it has been so refreshing to be able to learn something else. I feel that sense of satisfaction from getting something important done and also renewed in coding spirit from learning something new and interesting. 

So to all my fellow code friends out there, if you're ever feeling super stuck and really frustrated... instead of walking away and giving up entirely, start fresh with something new and find the excitement in learning again. When you have that spark back you'll feel the inspiration you need to go back and continue working on that really difficult thing you were doing that made you feel so "stuck" in the first place.

My Tip: If you're stuck, find something else to learn. It can be just as gratifying and leave you with a peace of mind that makes you feel refreshed and ready to take on the world again.
