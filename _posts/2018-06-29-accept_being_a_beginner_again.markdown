Let's face it. It's been a long day. You're frustrated. You're tired. You have a headache from the long, grueling hours you've spent slaving over a computer, making dinner, and then doing the dishes on top of everything else. You want to quit. You want to close your eyes and just make the whole world disappear. You just want to make the stress and all your fears go away. 

Breathe. 

Remember you are human.

Remember you are not alone. 

Remember you are okay.

You're not an expert. And that's okay. You're a beginner again. Being a beginner is hard. You have to leap into the unknown, not knowing the depths of the new waters you have just dived into. Sometimes it can feel like you're drowning. You're just so overwhelmed all you want to do is sink. But don't. Don't give up. Don't quit. Instead, embrace it. Just focus on getting your "brain" wet with all the new and exciting information. Think about how good it feels to know you are always learning something new and to be challenging yourself every day. It means that every day you are growing, reaching new heights, achieving things you didn't even know you were capable of. You don't have to remember everything. All you have to do is keep learning. That's it.  And you can learn anything. So just learn. That's what beginners do. 

You are a beginner.

And that's okay.

So don't just accept being a beginner... embrace it. Keep learning.
