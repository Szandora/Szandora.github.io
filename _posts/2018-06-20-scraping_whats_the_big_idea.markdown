The brain is interesting... it likes to hold onto things and absorb them like sponges. Whenever you learn something new, your brain is looking for something to hold onto so it can store and access that new information just like a computer. That is why, whenever I learn something new that is very complex, I try to look for the one singular most important concept about it that I should remember. And instead of focusing on my confusion, I focus on this concept instead. When you understand the foundation of something, you can start making even more connections to it. You are giving your brain something to work with. 

So what's the big idea with scraping? 

"You GET it" -- do you "get" it? 

Scraping GETS things. Think about it like this. Methods do things. Variables define things. Booleans evaluate things. Enumerators operate on things. Strings print things. And scraping gets things.

Scraping is a tool you can use to grab information off of a website and link that information directly to that really cool app you're building that shows the bus schedule for all the mass transit systems in NYC. Imagine how much harder it would be if every time something about the NYC bus schedule changed, you had to manually go into the app and change your app just to update that one teeny tiny piece of information. It would be brutal. Your life would literally become nothing but updating that app 24/7... and that's IF you could keep up with it. Scraping makes your life, and your really cool app, manageable. Scraping is your best friend. It's here to save you. Scraping is like the free beer your awesome girlfriend gives you after a really long, hard day of work (yes, I'm a chick and I'm writing this thinking about how that's something I do for my man at the end of a really brutal work day... I know, I'm awesome, you don't have to tell me.) 

So next time you're feeling all of that angst and rage against scraping, just remember... even though it seems terrible, it is... I mean, it's awesome. 

Oh, and of course... just remember, scraping GETS info from websites in the form of html with css selectors ;)
