It feels great to finally be getting deep into HTML and CSS. I can finally say I'm starting to feel like a real web developer. The labs and lessons for this section are just so exciting because everything is very hands on. Not only do you get to learn the ins and outs of what it feels like to work on front-end web development, but you get to see it as you're creating it. It's so exciting to be able to load up the webpage you're working on and see the changes you're making to your website as you're making them. 

I had a lot of fun learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS today. It was a good day coding, and I just wanted to blog about it because it's nice to reflect on the good days and share my love of coding with the world!

Happy coding and Happy 4th everyone! <3
