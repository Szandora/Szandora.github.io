"Come with me and you'll see a world of pure imagination," is one of my favorite Willy Wonka quotes. It perfectly describes what happens when you turn on a computer. The internet is gateway to a seemingly infinite amount of digital universes. And every one of those digital universes is a manifestation of something that came from someone's imagination. The internet is a magical place where we can make our dreams become a reality. I want to use technology to make the things I dream of become a reality one day too. This is why I have decided to finally become a software developer.

The journey ahead seems like a long winding road with many twists and turns, and I don't know what is going to happen... but that's what makes it so exciting. I can't wait to see what happens next. 

I know this is a short post, but that's because this is the beginning of my journey. So this is where I will leave you now, at my beginning.
