These are always fun. In order for any code to work you need variables and methods. I always try to start by thinking about what I want my program to do. When I know I need code to "do" something, I know that code is going to be a method. Methods make code do things. Methods are like little machines inside of programs that run blocks of code, telling it to do something. Variables, on the other hand, don't do things by themselves like methods do. Variables define things. Variables tell programs what something is. So in order to make a fully functioning program, it needs both variables and methods to tell the program what things are and what those things to do.
